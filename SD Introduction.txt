SYSTEM DESIGN

What is system design
set of requirements
- decide architecture
- decide components
- decide modules

how they interact each other for product dev

how to approach system design
- understand the problem statement
- break it down into components
- dissect each component

for each sub-component look into 
1. database and caching
2. scaling and fault tolerance
3. async processing (delegation)
4. communication
add sub-components if needed

big problem
- up-down approach
small detailed or specific/ focussed
- bottom-up approach  

for a good sys design
1. you broke your sys into components
2. every component has a clear set of responsibilities (exclusive)
3. for each component you have slight technical details figured out
4. each component (in isolation) is
	- scalable
	- fault tolerant
	- available
