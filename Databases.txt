II. Databases

1. Relational Databases

Relational Databases
- History of relational db
key properties are
	1.data consistency
	2.data durability
	3.data integrity
	4.constraints
	5.everything in on place

transactions
ACID 
Atomicity - all statements within a transaction takes effect or none
Consistency - data will never go incorrect, no matter what constraints, cascades, triggers
Isolation - when multiple transactions are executing parallely, the isolation level determines how much changes of one transaction are visible to other
Durability - when transaction commits, the changes outlives outage

--------------------------------------
2. Database Isolation levels

Isolation levels dictate how much one transaction knows about the other
a. Repeatable reads
	- consistent reads within same transaction
		even if other transaction committed 1st transaction would not see the changes (if value already read)

b. Read committed
	- reads within the same transaction always reads fresh value
		con: multiple reads within same transaction are inconsistent

c. Read uncommitted
	- reads every uncommitted values from other transactions
		"dirty reads"

d. Serializable
	- every read is a locking read (depends on engine)
	and while one transaction read, other transactions will have to wait

* storage engines can alter the implementation
